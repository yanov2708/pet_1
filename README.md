# Pet project :space_invader:

# Side win prediction based on score, duration and heroes data

The idea of predicting the outcome of a match after its completion may not seem very interesting and applied.

But I chose such a task in order to go through the main stages such as: 
* data scraping
* data analysis and cleaning 
* building several models and choosing the best one.
* hypothesis testing


I presented the implementation in the streamlit cloud - [link](https://yanov2708-pet-1-app-kcwzyj.streamlit.app/)

The detailed steps are described in the notebook and .py files
